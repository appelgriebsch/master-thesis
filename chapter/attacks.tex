\section{\gls{E-commerce} fraud incidents}
\label{sec:scenario_fraud}

Based on the previous sections one can come up with strategies fraudsters might use to trick the \gls{E-commerce} system. To do so the criminal will have to get access to credit card information in the first place. Therefore this section first looks into ways a criminal might get access to credit card and personal information in the \gls{E-commerce} scenario. After that the section describes possible strategies fraudsters can use to trick the system. The section ends with a discussion of the \gls{E-commerce} fraud incident handling as it is in place today.

\subsection{Credit Card data breaches}
\label{subsec:leaking_credit_cards}

 In the Section~\ref{sec:stakeholder_data_flow} one could already figure out the parties, who have access to or store credit card information in the \gls{E-commerce} scenario, namely:\@

\begin{itemize}
  \item the consumer as owner of the credit card
  \item the issuing bank, who handed out the credit card to the consumer
  \item the merchant, if the consumer is paying with a credit card
  \item the Payment Service Provider, if the consumer is paying with a credit card online
\end{itemize}

The \gls{PSP} does receive the credit card information from the merchant during the authorization of the payment. If the \gls{PSP} does the authorization themselves, they are also the participant, who stores and holds the credit card information in their back-end databases. As mentioned earlier the \gls{PSP} should follow industry standards and guidelines for storing and processing payment-related information; especially the \gls{PCI/DSS} standard \citep{virtue2009payment}. In addition they are responsible for monitoring their systems with an intrusion detection program. This will trigger a signal as soon as an hacker got access to the internal databases. In that case the \gls{PSP} can put the leaked credit card information on an internal blacklist, so that these cards could no longer be used for further payments online. Additionally they will have to send a message to the corresponding issuers, to which the \gls{PSP} generally maintains a strong business relationship. The issuer will inform the affected credit card owners and send out a new credit card to each of them. Due to this procedure in place, one can assume that the safety and security of credit card handling at the \gls{PSP} can be guaranteed. \\

The merchant receives the credit card information during the checkout process from the consumer. The credit card information is transfered via the public Internet from the consumer to the merchant and could be a victim of a man-in-the-middle attack, in which the hacker is intercepting the communication between the consumer and the merchant with the objective to capture the personal and payment-related information from the data transmission stream. Therefore the merchant should offer the Web shop via a secure communication channel only. For that they can use industry standards such as \gls{TLS} to encrypt the information send between both parties. This will make it more difficult for an attacker to get to the plain-text information exchanged between consumer and merchant during the checkout process. As the merchant is not processing the credit card information directly, they also do not have to store them in their own back-end databases. The merchant is asking the \gls{PSP} or issuer of the card for authorization of the credit card payment and receives an unique payment token in response, if the authorization was successful. As stated in the \gls{PCI/DSS} standard \citep{virtue2009payment} a merchant should \textbf{\underline{never}} store the whole credit card information in their own databases, but should use this unique payment token and shortened credit card data (especially abbreviated credit card numbers) to refer to a specific payment later. Due to this procedure in place one can conclude, that breaking into the systems of a merchant will not result in any leaked credit card information, if the merchant follows these guidelines. \\

The issuer is a valuable target for hacking into the back-end systems with the objective to leak a massive amount of credit card and personal related information. As a financial institute the issuer also have to follow a huge set of regulations and safety procedures to be able to participate on the market. It can be assumed that at least the same safety mechanisms are valid as are in place for the \gls{PSP}. This means constantly monitoring the internal systems with an intrusion detection mechanism and blacklisting any leaked credit card. In addition to the monitoring of all online activities (as also the \gls{PSP} does) the issuing bank can monitor activities done with the credit card in the offline world too. In case of suspicious activities the credit card can be blocked immediately, and a new one will be send out to the credit card owner. \\

The consumer is also a valuable target for eavesdropping on credit card and personal related information. They are also the weakest and most insecure party in the whole E-commerce scenario. As said above a lot of the protection mechanisms of the other participants are relying on following industry standards, and on constantly monitoring the own systems for malicious activities. This can not be securely said about the computer of the consumer though. Whether they are using up-to-date security programs (e.g.\ an Anti-virus tool and a firewall) on their computer or not is out of reach of the other actors to verify. Additionally, a consumer can fall victim to a phishing attack, that will send them to a malicious Web site with the intend to get their personal related information. In some seldom cases the consumer might cooperate with fraudsters, or might be the impostor themselves with the intent to trick the system for their self-interest. Due to these facts the \gls{E-commerce} fraud investigation can not rely on information from the consumer at all, but instead has to figure out if the transaction in question was made from the real owner of the credit card or from a deceiver.

\subsection{E-commerce fraud strategies}
\label{subsec:strategies_fraudster}

After fraudsters have got access to leaked credit card information they can come up with the following strategies to trick the \gls{E-commerce} system:\@

\begin{enumerate}
  \item a deceiver owns \textbf{one} leaked credit card information and try to use it for ordering products from \textbf{multiple} merchants on the Internet
  \item a deceiver owns \textbf{multiple} leaked credit card information and try to use them for ordering products from \textbf{one} merchant on the Internet
  \item a combination of the two cases mentioned before, that can also be related to as a series of the first fraud activity
\end{enumerate}

In the first scenario, in which the fraudsters are trying out a leaked credit card for ordering products on Web shops of various merchants, each of the merchant only sees the transaction that takes place in their system. It will make it more difficult for the merchant to detect whether this is a fraud transaction or not, because they are not aware of the attempts the fraudsters did on other merchant's Web shops. \\

As each merchant will rely on a \gls{PSP} or issuer to verify the credit card payment, it is in the responsibility of these participants to recognize fraud transactions in this scenario. To be able to do so, the \gls{PSP} and also the issuer are monitoring the usage of credit cards and are actively looking for suspicious activities. The fraud prevention mechanisms in place are mostly working on rule-based, and in some cases also on score-based systems running in the internal network of the \gls{PSP} and issuer. These systems are fed with the information the merchant sends with the payment authorization request and will come up with either:\@

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Yes, this looks like a fraudulent transaction and has to be blocked
  \item No, this seems to be a valid transaction and should be acknowledged
  \item Maybe, this transaction might be valid, but there is some uncertainty in the validation of it. These edge cases are routed to a human operator of the \gls{PSP} or issuer to decide on how to proceed with them.
\end{enumerate}

As a recent study shows the success rate of the fraud prevention systems heavily relies on the techniques used to validate the transaction data \citep{rana2015survey}. The outcome is, that ca. 70 to 80\% of the fraudulent transactions will be recognized as such and blocked successfully. That still means up to 30 percent of fraudulent transactions could not be identified as such. For handling these cases the organizations employ special trained staff, that is operating 24/7 and 365 days a year, to be able to manage these edge cases. \\

As stated in the introductory section of this Master thesis, there is a shift from the offline credit card fraud to the online world. This is also resembled in current figures of \gls{E-commerce} fraud incidents, whose show that it makes up to 85 percent of all credit card fraud attempts and have on average a transaction value of 500 to 600 EUR.\\

As the \gls{PSP}s and the issuers do not have any order details, they can only decide on the information given during the authorization request (see Section~\ref{sec:stakeholder_analysis}). At most they can validate the branch the merchant is operating in, and it might come as no surprise that the fraudsters are regularly using Web shops of merchants, who offer either electronics, clothings, entertainment- or travel-related products and services. These are also the most commonly used sources of \textbf{\underline{valid}} \gls{E-commerce} transactions, and will therefore make any fraudulent transactions very difficult to detect. \\

At the end it might be the owners of a credit card, who detect suspicious activities on their credit card account and inform their issuing bank about it. Based on current regulations and laws the issuing bank has to rollback the fraudulent transaction on request of the consumer, which means that the merchant will have to cover the costs of the \gls{E-commerce} fraud (as they are not receiving the money for the products that have been already shipped to the fraudsters). \\

Looking at the second scenario of the \gls{E-commerce} fraud strategies at the beginning of this section, a merchant will receive multiple requests from a deceiver, who is trying out various leaked credit cards for finishing an order. This kind of \gls{E-commerce} fraud can be recognized at the systems of the merchant due to the same source \gls{IP} address of the requests, or due to having the same shipping address for orders with different credit cards. Therefore, one can conclude that also merchants must take an active role in the fraud prevention process (if they do not already do so) and try to minimize the amount of fraudulent transactions taken place in their Web shops. As this scenario is likely be manageable with additional fraud prevention mechanisms at the merchant, and does not need to involve other parties of the \gls{E-commerce} scenario to figure out the validity of the transaction, this second scenario falls out of scope of this Master thesis.

\subsection{E-commerce fraud incidents handling}
\label{subsec:e_commerce_fraud_handling}

If the fraud prevention systems at the \gls{PSP} or issuer are detecting a suspicious transaction, an operator working in a special department within the organization will be informed about this transaction via a notification on his computer. This operator will have to decide whether the transaction looks valid and should be acknowledged, or seems to be fraudulent and has to be denied. To be able to decide this, they are going to look into the recent usages of the credit card in question. Whereas it will be easy to recognize that a credit card, that was just being used in a shop in Germany, could not be used in a shop in US or Asia within a short time-frame due to physical constraints in the real world, the same consumer can order products from an US or Asian online retailer with ease within minutes. So these initial geographical constraints, that work well with real-world usage patterns of credit cards (a proven fraud prevention mechanism called Geo-fencing), will no longer work so well in the \gls{E-commerce} scenario. \\

So the operator has to found their decision on the transaction information at hand. Initially they can check for the amount that has been paid with the credit card. One can assume that small amounts will be covered by the \gls{PSP} or issuer, who will take over the risk for a false authorization. But with an increased value of the items ordered, the \gls{PSP} or issuer is putting back the risk to the merchant in case of any consumer complaints later. At a second glance the operator can verify whether the consumer has had any business relationship with the merchant in the past or not as well as verify the retail branch the merchant operates in. But these are weak hints for investigating the validity of an \gls{E-commerce} transaction as they can be bypassed by the fraudsters with ease (see the explanations above). \\

To make a solid decision the operator will have to get in contact with the merchants the credit card has been used with recently, and have to ask for additional information such as:\@

\begin{itemize}
  \item does the consumer owns an user account with the Web shop?
  \item what is the consumer usually looking for in the Web shop?
  \item does the shipping address matches the billing address for the order?
  \item if not, has the user send orders to this shipping address in the past?
  \item what has been ordered, incl.\ detailed product information such as brand, model, product categories, \ldots
\end{itemize}

In some cases the \gls{PSP} or issuer have had a business relationship with the online merchant in the past. So the \gls{PSP} or issuer might already know whom to contact from the support personnel of the merchant. But in most cases the contact person might not be known to the \gls{PSP} or issuer resulting in sending a request to the general support staff via the contact forms on the merchants Web site. \\

Getting the right information will still take time, because the correct addressee from the support department of the merchant is unknown, the merchant do not have specialized staff at hand to handle these kind of queries, or there are misunderstandings on handling the case due to language barriers or different incentives between the communication participants. Additionally the operator, who is responsible for the case, has to collect the available information from these merchants, notes them down and tries to build a ``picture'' out of it. In case the initial information received from one of the participants have not been enough, the operator will have to get in contact with the support personnel again. This can result in a lengthy sequence of communication attempts and question-response processes between the operator and the affected online merchants. Due to this, getting an in-depth overview of suspicious credit card usages in the \gls{E-commerce} scenario is likely taking hours if not days or weeks. That is definitely way to much time and effort to look into any of these transactions. Therefore one can assume that this detailed analysis of any suspicious transaction will not take place today; instead most of these transactions will be acknowledged without any doubt after a first short look and plausibility check. \\

Still the merchants as well as the \gls{PSP}s and issuers have a high incentive for increasing the success rates of their fraud prevention, and keeping the numbers of successful fraudulent activities low. For the \gls{PSP}s and issuers there are regulations stating that at maximum only one thousands of the overall transactions\footnote{numbers stated are valid for the EU} should be fraudulent. This keeps the pressure on these financial institutes to invest in fraud prevention techniques for being able to stay in business. For the merchant it is also of high interest, that a fraudulent transaction can be resolved before the deceiver receives the ordered products. In the worst case scenario just one successfully performed fraudulent transaction in an \gls{E-commerce} shop will trigger hundreds if not thousands of subsequent attempts from other fraudsters, as past experiences have shown.
