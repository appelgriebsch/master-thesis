\todo{ca. 25 pages}

This chapter will lay out the theoretical foundations for the to-be-designed collaborative system.
It will start with an investigation of the \gls{CSCW} system theory followed by a detailed examination of the
Semantic Web standards like \gls{RDF}, \gls{OWL} and \gls{SPARQL} and how they can be used within Semantic Web agents.
Last but not least the chapter will look into the concepts of \gls{P2P} communication technologies by looking into various
protocols for information sharing in detail --- e.g. \gls{XMPP}, \gls{WebRTC} as well as less known ones like BitTorrent and BitMessage.
