\chapter{Concept for a system supporting \gls{E-commerce} fraud investigations} % (fold)
\label{cha:system_concept}

This chapter looks specifically into the concept of a collaborative system that will improve the situation described in the scenario in Section~\ref{sec:scope_thesis}. To do this, the chapter will discuss the overall concept of such a system on an high level without going to much into implementation specific details. At the end, the chapter will have answered the question of what the system is, and what should be able to achieve with it. In addition to these discussions, the chapter will further look into existing design approaches and analyses why they are of no use for the specific scenario of this Master thesis.
