\chapter{Concept for a system supporting \gls{E-commerce} fraud investigations} % (fold)
\label{cha:system_concept}

This first section of the main part of the Master thesis looks into the concept  of a collaborative system that will improve the situation described in the scenario in Section~\ref{sec:scope_thesis}. Initially this chapter will discuss the overall concept of the proposed system on an high level without going to much into implementation specifics. This will answer the question of what the system is and should be able to achieve. After this initial conceptual view the chapter will further look into existing design approaches and discusses why they are of no use in this specific situation.
