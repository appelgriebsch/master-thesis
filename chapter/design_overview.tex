\section{Concept of System}
\label{sec:system_concept}

Based on the explanations in Chapter~\ref{cha:context_analysis}, and especially the scope definition for this Master thesis in Section~\ref{sec:scope_thesis}, the collaborative system for investigating E-commerce fraud incidents have to answer the central question:\@

\begin{quotation}
    \textit{Is this really a fraudulent E-commerce transaction?}
\end{quotation}

The relevant stakeholders, that need to be involved in the investigation process, are:\@

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{merchant}, who can provide additional information of each E-commerce transaction in question
    \item \textbf{\gls{PSP}/issuer}, whose offer information about the credit card usage pattern and the original credit card owner
    \item \textbf{\gls{LSP}}, who can offer information about whether the order has already been shipped or not, and in the former case to whom it has been handed over
    \item \textbf{\gls{ISP}}, who can on request give hints whether a consumer has fallen victim to a phishing attack based on her Internet access logs
\end{enumerate}

Ideally each of them would make parts of their internal data structures available for the other participants to access and query for. This would allow the stakeholder, who has to authorize or validate a suspecious credit card payment, to analyse all available information, as depicted in the Figure~\ref{fig:images_system_overview}.\@

\end{figure}

Due to the fact that data from various sources has to be combined into a shared understanding of the E-commerce activities of a consumer, there is the need to harmonize and transform the information into a shared data model. Based on the discussion in Chapter~\ref{cha:context_analysis} and the analysis of the information each stakeholder holds and transmits to others, the following initial schema can be conducted (see Figure~\ref{fig:images_data_model}). This figure shows the relevant information from the local contexts of each stakeholder and how they can be combined within a shared information space. \\

\begin{figure}[!ht]

  \caption{Information relations between stakeholders (green: Issuer, red: \gls{PSP}, yellow: Merchant, blue: \gls{LSP})}
\label{fig:images_data_model}
\end{figure}

As one can see there are connection points between these stakeholders. Those can be used as a reference for doing the merging of the information. There are 3 major connection points: \@

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{payment token}: shared between merchant and \gls{PSP}
  \item \textbf{tracking number}: shared between merchant and \gls{LSP}
  \item \textbf{credit card}: shared between issuer and \gls{PSP}
\end{enumerate}

In addition to these connection points one can also see the validation points in the Figure~\ref{fig:images_data_model}. These are critical points that state whether an E-commerce transaction is suspecious or not. The criterias are: \@

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{billing address}: the billing address of the order has to match the registered address of the owner of the credit card used
  \item \textbf{recipient}: the recipient of the delivery should be related to the owner of the credit card
\end{enumerate}

Whereas the first criteria can be examined during the authorization process of the credit card payment based on the transmitted information between merchant and \gls{PSP}, the second one is more difficult to verify (or can not be verified at all).
