\section{System Design Proposal}
\label{sec:design_proposal}

As the previous section showed, existing approaches are of limited use for the design of a collaborative system to support the \gls{E-commerce} fraud investigation scenario described in Section~\ref{sec:scope_thesis}. The leading approach for such a system will have to combine the best characteristics from the Web Service and the Semantic Web designs. \\

As for the Web Service approach, the most valuable aspects of it are: \@

\begin{itemize}
	\item access to the \gls{HTTP} endpoints can be limited to a certain set of communication partners
	\item these partners have to authenticate with each Web Service first
	\item based on the identification of the partners only certain parts of information can be returned, and execution of operations can be restricted
\end{itemize}

Looking at the Semantic Web approach, it's most interesting functionalities are: \@

\begin{itemize}
	\item providing information in a semantically self-contained way
	\item the ability to merge information from different \gls{RDF} data stores
	\item the graph-based data model underlying the \gls{RDF} data stores
	\item the usage of \gls{SPARQL} to query and analyze the locally combined data sets
\end{itemize}

In the following section the thesis will come up with an approach that uses the fundamental technologies from the Semantic Web for information sharing and integration as well as peer-to-peer communication technologies for securing and restricting access to the \gls{RDF} data sets from the relevant participants of the \gls{E-commerce} fraud investigation scenario. It will start with a discussion of the semantics of the underlying \gls{RDF} files and how these can be combined across various organizations. After that it shows how these information can be provided to the relevant parties in the investigation scenario. It will continue with a detailed look into the partially centralized \gls{P2P} communication architecture and how that can be used for the proposed solution.

\subsection{Vocabulary alignment}
\label{subsec:vocab_align}

Although the \gls{RDF} format has build-in support for merging information from different data sources, this functionality is only working as expected if the ``triples'' in the dispersed data stores are using the same \gls{URI}s to refer to the same subjects or objects. In that case merging the ``triples'' from different \gls{RDF} data files will result in a local graph holding the combined information as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:images_combine_rdf_graph}. \\

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\label{fig:images_combine_rdf_graph}
\end{figure}

As a major objective of the \gls{E-commerce} fraud investigation system is to bring the various transactional information from online merchants, \gls{PSP}s and issuers together, combine them all and analyze the resulting graph from different viewpoints, the information exchanged between the relevant participants have to follow a common schema. A possible approach is to define a completely new schema for the proposed system and share it with every possible stakeholder. This schema will define all the entities and relations known to the collaborative system and would be expressed in \gls{RDFS} format. A major drawback of this approach is, that new partners of the system will have to do the conversion of their internal data structures to an \gls{RDF} file, that is compatible with the specific schema definition, before being able to participate in it. \\

Therefore a better approach is to take a look into commonly used \gls{RDF} schemata and vocabularies, and try to figure out if they can be used for describing the information, that need to be exchanged between participants of the \gls{E-commerce} fraud investigation system. When consulting the Semantic Web community for commonly agreed upon and highly referenced \gls{RDF} schema definitions, one will come up with this list (see Table~\ref{tab:used_vocab_rdf}):\@

\begin{table}[H]

\end{table}

Based on these schema specifications describing a fictive consumer named ``Max Mustermann'' incl.\ his home address can be done by combining data utilizing the \gls{FOAF} and \gls{vCard} namespaces in a \gls{RDF} file, such as described in Listing~\ref{lst:sample_customer_mustermann} and visualized as graph in Figure~\ref{fig:images_sample_customer}. \@

               numbersep=5pt,
               breaklines=true,
               frame=lines]{TURTLE}
               {./samples/sample_customer_mustermann.ttl}

	\caption{Graph representation of consumer information from Listing~\ref{lst:sample_customer_mustermann}}
\label{fig:images_sample_customer}
\end{figure}

Looking back to the initial data model from Section~\ref{sec:system_concept} one can map the information, that are currently available in the \gls{E-commerce} scenario, to the existing \gls{RDF} vocabularies such as follows (see Table~\ref{tab:map_tx_rdf_vocab}):\@

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{p{5cm}l}
\hline
\textbf{Information} & \textbf{RDF vocabulary} \\
\hline

\hline
Credit Card Owner & FOAF \\
\hline
Billing Address & vCard \\
\hline

\hline
Location Information & Geo Names \\
\hline

\hline

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Possible usage of \gls{RDF} vocabularies for \gls{E-commerce} transaction information}
\label{tab:map_tx_rdf_vocab}
\end{table}

As this table shows there are some parts of the \gls{E-commerce} data model that can be expressed with existing \gls{RDF} vocabularies extensively --- such as personal related information via \gls{FOAF} and \gls{vCard}, whereas other parts can not be stated in-depth (e.g. credit card information), or are not specified at all (e.g.\ tracking of the delivery). Additionally some of the vocabularies are no longer actively maintained, such as GoodRelations. Due to these circumstances one usually have to build an own ontology that fills in the missing pieces and refers to the existing concepts whenever appropriate. Trying to model the information of a credit card as displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:images_data_model} will result in the \gls{RDFS} specification shown in Listing~\ref{lst:credit_card_vocab}. \@

\begin{listing}[H]
  \inputminted[linenos,
               numbersep=5pt,
               breaklines=true,
               frame=lines]{TURTLE}
               {./samples/vocab_credit_card.ttl}
  \caption{A specification for a credit card in \gls{RDFS}}
\label{lst:credit_card_vocab}
\end{listing}

But building a new ontology for handling the \gls{E-commerce} fraud investigation process is not the best approach. The result would be that participants have to access, understand and implement the desired \gls{RDF} data schema first, before they can share their information in the collaborative system. Looking back at the list of existing ontologies and vocabularies, that are actively used on the Web today, one will find the Schema.org vocabulary definition \citep{Schema.org}. This vocabulary was initially designed by the leading search engines (aka Google, Microsoft and Yahoo!) to allow authors of Web sites to markup their \gls{HTML} documents in a way, that they are better understood by those search engines (aka \gls{SEO}). The Schema.org vocabulary is actively maintained by its community, includes new concepts with each release and also offers an extension mechanism to implement additional vocabularies that are not part of the core specification \citep{SchemaExtensions}. In one of the past releases of the Schema.org core specification it also included all of the existing concepts of the GoodRelation ontology \citep{SchemaGoodRelation}. \\

As the merchants will provide semantic meta data for their products to improve their listing on search engine results (aka \gls{SEO}) in the vocabulary of Schema.org already, one can re-use parts of these information for the \gls{E-commerce} fraud investigation. Additionally, the wide-ranging scope of aspects that Schema.org declares make it a good fit to the \gls{E-commerce} fraud investigation scenario. Trying to map the initial data model from Section~\ref{sec:system_concept} to the Schema.org core specification will result in a data schema as displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:images_schema_org}. \@

\subsection{Communication protocols}
\label{subsec:comm_protocol}

 The data is likely encoded in Microdata, \gls{RDFa} or \gls{JSON-LD}. \\

For the communication the \gls{WebRTC} is a good approach as it integrates well with existing enterprise IT infrastructures.

\subsection{Using a partially centralized \gls{P2P} system}
\label{subsec:p2p_partially_centralized_system}

For the \gls{E-commerce} fraud scenario, that has been selected for this thesis in Section~\ref{sec:thesis_scope}, one can say that the issuer of a credit card is the party who initiates the collaborative fraud investigation. They are recognizing the active use (and likely misuse) of a credit card in the online and the offline world first, and are also getting a notification about any suspicious transactions made with it from their fraud prevention systems. Due to this fact, one can come up with a partially centralized \gls{P2P} architecture for the \gls{E-commerce} fraud investigation system, in that the issuer of a card in at the center and acts as a trusted party in this system. This issuer will initiate a collaborative session with the other required stakeholders based on the usage history of the credit card in question. During this \gls{P2P} communication session the merchants, \gls{PSP}s and \gls{LSP}s will share the required information with the issuer. In this process the data from the other stakeholders will be replicated to the issuer, who will build up a networked graph based on the Schema.org specification. So the main work will be on the issuer's side, who is the major driving party in the system, as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:images_p2p_centralized}.\@

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{images/system_P2P_centralized.pdf}
	\caption{Collaborative system using a partially centralized \gls{P2P} architecture}
\label{fig:images_p2p_centralized}
\end{figure}

Using the \gls{WebRTC} communication protocol for initiating the \gls{P2P} session will allow the issuers to setup a communication between the relevant stakeholders directly from within an application running in their Web browsers. The application can visualize the connectivity status of the participants, the progress of their data sharing efforts as well as offer direct face-to-face communication possibilities in case of misunderstandings or further requests. A wireframe of the Web application screen is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:images_p2p_initial_screen}. \@

	\caption{Screen prototype of collaborative system showing participants and shared information}
\label{fig:images_p2p_initial_screen}
\end{figure}

One of the major issues with the above mentioned system architecture is, that the merchants, \gls{PSP}s and \gls{LSP}s have to hand over all of their relevant information to the issuer of a credit card for the analysis. \\
