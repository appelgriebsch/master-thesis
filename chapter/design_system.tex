\chapter{Design of a collaborative system} % (fold)
\label{cha:system_design}

This chapter is about the design of a collaborative system that supports the investigation of \gls{E-commerce} fraud incidents. It starts with a discussion of the semantics of the underlying \gls{RDF} data sets, and how these can be combined across various organizations. After that it shows how these information can be provided by the relevant participants based on the \gls{E-commerce} fraud investigation scenario described in Chapter~\ref{cha:context_analysis}. For this purpose it looks in detail into the partially centralized \gls{P2P} communication architecture, and shows how that can be used for securely sharing the relevant information between the stakeholders.
