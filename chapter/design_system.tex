\chapter{Concept and Design of the System} % (fold)
\label{cha:design_system}

This main part of the Master thesis looks into the concept and design of a collaborative system that will improve the situation described in the scenario in Section~\ref{sec:scope_thesis}. Initially this chapter will discuss the overall concept of the proposed system on an high level without going to much into implementation specifics. This will answer the question of what the system is and should be able to achieve. After this initial conceptual view the chapter will further look into existing design approaches and discusses why they are of no use in this specific situation. Lastly a novel system design approach is proposed, which is based on Semantic Web and peer-to-peer communication technologies to improve the current situation, and support the investigation of E-commerce fraud incidents in an inter-institutional team.
