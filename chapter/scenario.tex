\section{Scenario Description}
\label{sec:scenario_description}

``E-Commerce is basically trading in product or services using computer network such as the Internet'' \citep{sen2015study}.
It is usually categorized into four different forms \citep{sen2015study}:\@

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Business-To-Business (B2B)}: refers to electronic trading between companies with the objective to improve the supply chain processes
  \item \textbf{Business-To-Consumer (B2C)}: refers to electronic trading between a company and it's consumers (e.g. Amazon)
  \item \textbf{Consumer-To-Consumer (C2C)}: refers to electronic trading between consumers (e.g.\ eBay)
  \item \textbf{Consumer-To-Business (C2B)}: referes to electronic trading between consumer and business (e.g. MyHammer)
\end{enumerate}

This Master thesis will focus on the B2C aspect of E-Commerce. In that case a consumer is using an E-Commerce shop of a merchant on the Internet to
order products or services online. The merchant is offering a catalog of available products or services on the Web, that is available and accessible
by the general public and usually has a global reach. The merchant can either run the E-Commerce shop software on her own servers or can outsource this additional business channel to a 3$^{rd}$ party hoster or cloud
service provider (CSP). Also the shop software itself can either be provided by the merchant or bought on the software market from an Independent Software Vendor (ISV).
For business accounting purposes the merchant also runs a bank account with the acquirer. \\
When placing an order with the merchant online the consumer is normally using a credit card for finalizing the transaction. This credit card has been handed out by the issuing bank to the consumer.
Additionally some online shops require the consumer to create an user account while others do not. The former is the preferred way when consumers are repetitively buying from that merchant
whereas the latter might be used for one-time shopping trips online. To connect to the Internet the consumer relies on a service of an Internet Service Provider (ISP). \\

\end{figure}

When the consumer places the order online the merchant receives a list of products or services from the current shopping cart of the consumer as well as the delivery address for the items.
If the transaction is going to be finalized with a credit card the consumer will have to state additional information like billing address and credit card information (incl.\ credit card number, validity date and security number).
The merchant does not validate the credit card information on her own. For that purpose she is usually relying on another 3$^{rd}$ party service offered on the Internet by the Payment Service Provider (PSP).
These providers are either validating the credit card information themselves based on a given user profile (e.g.\ PayPal) or connecting to the issuing bank of the card for doing it. In this process the merchant is
handing over the following information to the PSP:\@

\begin{itemize}
    \item consumer's billing address
    \item given credit card number, validity date and security number
    \item final amount of the transaction being processed
\end{itemize}

The merchant receives a status of the authorization as well as an authorization code in return.

- the merchant have a business relationship with her own bank and uses the service to acquire the outstanding amounts from consumers \\
- in the clearing process the acquiring bank is settling any outstanding transaction with an issuing bank \\
\\
Workshop ErsteBank Wien: \\
- usually banks are monitoring the usage of credit / debit cards and are looking for suspicious activities \\
- this fraud prevention mechanism is working on a rule-based (non self-learning) or score-based (self-learning) software from a third party \\
- the outcome of the fraud prevention could be: yes (this is a fraudulent transaction, pls. block it), no (everything looks fine, pls. continue with the process) or maybe (uncertain, pls. let a human decide how to proceed) \\
- in case of the maybe result an alert is triggered to one of the support staff of the bank (operating 24/7/365) \\
- still this kind of fraud prevention mgmt. can not solve all issues due to the amount and frequency of the transactions, there is generally a
fraud-to-sales ratio of max. 0.11 percent in the EU (meaning 1 promille of transactions are fraudulent) \\
- still the success rate of fraud prevention is rougly 70-80 percent, means of the fraudulent transactions nearly 80 percent are blocked correctly \\
- for the rest: the consumer has to actively trigger an investigation, if the case is valid usually the issuing bank will cover the cost (in case of larger amounts an insurance will take over). \\
- the bank is responsible for pushing the consumer to file a case at police \\
- most of the filed cases could not be resolved \\
- there is no court decision yet in which circumstances the consumer might be guilty as well \\
\\
- ca. 85 percent of frauds are e-commerce frauds (EU: 70-90 percent). Hotspots are Germany, France and US. Frauds are coming from Travel-Shops or Online Merchants and the amount is on average between 500-600 EUR \\
- e-Commerce frauds will usually not filed at police; in most cases the acquirer is in charge to handle the issue \\
- if it is known that a merchant has been hacked the bank is usually issuing new credit cards to all affected consumers automatically \\
- otherwise the bank has to get in contact with the acquirer and/or merchant to figure out if the transaction is fraudulent \\
- usually the banks only have credit card related information from a consumer (no detailed information about the ongoing transaction), whereas the merchant and the acquirer have the detailed records of the order at hand \\
- various regulations make it hard to shre detailed information with involved parties (even if they have special agreements signed between them) \\
- main questions for e-commerce fraud: who is the party that is the victim of the incident? Is it really a fraudulent transaction? \\
- e-commerce fraud can not be handled by technology alone, at best the fraudulent transaction can be blocked on the merchant side (due to the information given by the consumer like items, prices, delivery address, ...) \\
- in the worst case one successful fraudulent transaction in an e-commerce shop will trigger hundred and thousands of attempts -> so the awareness for the issue has to be at merchant side \\
- at the end: much effort is assumed to bring all the experts together and solve the issue by putting their individual know-how on the table \\
