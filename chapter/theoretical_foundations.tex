\chapter{Theoretical Foundations} % (fold)
\label{cha:theoretical_foundations}

This chapter will lay out the theoretical foundations for the to-be-designed collaborative system. It will start with an investigation of the \gls{CSCW} system theory followed by a detailed examination of the Semantic Web standards like \gls{RDF}, \gls{OWL} and \gls{SPARQL} and how they can be used within Semantic Web agents. Last but not least the chapter will look into the concepts of \gls{P2P} communication technologies by looking into various protocols for information sharing in detail --- e.g. \gls{XMPP} and \gls{WebRTC}.
