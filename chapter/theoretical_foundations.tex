\chapter{Theoretical Foundations} % (fold)
\label{cha:theoretical_foundations}

This chapter will lay out the theoretical foundations for the to-be-designed collaborative system. It will start with an investigation of the \gls{CSCW} system theory followed by a detailed examination of the Semantic Web standards such as \gls{RDF}, \gls{OWL} and \gls{SPARQL}. Last but not least the chapter will look into the core concepts of \gls{P2P} communication technologies and protocols such as \gls{XMPP} and \gls{WebRTC}.
