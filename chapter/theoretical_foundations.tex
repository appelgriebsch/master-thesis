\chapter{Theoretical Foundations} % (fold)
\label{cha:theoretical_foundations}

This chapter lays out the theoretical foundations for the collaborative system that will be designed in Chapter~\ref{cha:system_concept} and Chapter~\ref{cha:system_design}. It starts with an investigation of the \gls{CSCW} system theory followed by a detailed examination of the Semantic Web standards such as \gls{RDF}, \gls{OWL} and \gls{SPARQL}. Last but not least, the chapter looks into core concepts of \gls{P2P} communication technologies and protocols such as \gls{WebRTC}.
